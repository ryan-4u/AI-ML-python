### 🧭 About This Repo
This repository was created during my **AI/ML training period** to explore **Python programming** and basic **Machine Learning concepts**.  
It serves as a record of my learning journey and will be structured further as projects are added.  

---

### 🛠️ What I Learned
- **Python basics** — syntax, control flow, functions  
- **Libraries for data analysis & visualization**:  
  - `NumPy` — numerical computing  
  - `Pandas` — data manipulation and analysis  
  - `Matplotlib` — plotting and visualization  
  - `Seaborn` — statistical data visualization  

---

### 🚀 Projects
- **Coming soon!**  
- All AI/ML projects will be added to the **Mini Projects repository** and linked here once ready.  

---

### 📚 Notes
- This repo reflects my **hands-on practice during training**.  
- The structure will be refined as projects are added.
